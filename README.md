# VS Code Backup

**VS Code Backup** is a **BASH** script that can be used to backup and restore all your visual studio code extensions manually without any need to sign in to your GitHub/Microsoft accounts.

You can take a look at the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/Osama-Yusuf/VS-Code-Backup).


## Features

* Backup Extensions
* Restore Extensions


## Getting started

Download the script and give it execution permission using this command:

```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Osama-Yusuf/VS-Code-Backup/main/vs_extension.sh" -o vs_extension.sh && chmod +x vs_extension.sh
```

## Usage for Linux & Windows
### but for windows Git-Bash must be installed, Or this script won't work. Open git bash termainl as adminstrator then

First copy it to the binaries folder to run it as a command without the extension (.sh)

### For linux use sudo:

```
sudo cp vs_extension.sh /usr/bin/vs_extension
```

### For windows open git bash as admin and remove sudo:

```
 cp vs_extension.sh /usr/bin/vs_extension
``` 

You can delete the script now if you want.

```
rm -f vs_extension.sh
```

Then execute the script and let it do all the work:

```
vs_extension
```
or
```
source vs_extension.sh
```
or
```
bash vs_extension.sh
```
